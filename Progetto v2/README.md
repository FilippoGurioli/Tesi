# Distributed XR game thesis

This repository contains a web app named Yu-Gi-Oh! - XR made using BABYLON.js and Croquet.io and the thesis document that describes the work done.

In detail the video game has as objective to create a shared XR experience thanks to the use of WebXR.

For more information on the project, please refer to the thesis document.


## How to run the application

To run the application you need to have node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/it/download/.

Since WebXR only works on secure sites (https) or localhost, in order to launch the application with a specific IP address, you must associate a certificate to the web page. To do this, install all dependencies and then run the application, launch boot.sh script.
